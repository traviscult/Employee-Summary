# Team Profile Generator 
I created an in line command application that gathers user input via inquirer. Based on the users input an HTML roster is created with each team members pertinent information.


## User Story
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```
